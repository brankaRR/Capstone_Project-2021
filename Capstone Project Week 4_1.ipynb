As the location is one of the main factors in opening a new restaurant we will focus on the restaurant business around the London area in this report. The first step in opening a new restaurant is deciding what type of restaurant it is going to be? Because that's already decided and it's going to be a specific type of cuisine i.e Mexican restaurant, now choosing the location of the restaurant is one of the most imortant decisions. Will it be in a busy area with plenty of foot traffic, or is there enough parking or are there any other restaurants opened or closed in the same spot?\nWe will focus on the neighborhoods that has no or least Mexican restourants, also will take into consideration (with help of clustering) which neighbourhoods are similar and most like Mexican food but at the sam time has no or very little Mexican restaurants. Then I will hopefully come to a conclusion where it is a good place to open a new Mexican restaurant."
